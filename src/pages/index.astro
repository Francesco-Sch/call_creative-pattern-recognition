						Dear artist/designer/researcher/critical thinker/scientist
					</p>
					<p>
						Creative Pattern Recognition is a publication and platform on
						artificial intelligence in art and design practice. The publication
						reflects on the current state of AI in art and design and explores
						practices, tools and methodologies for co-creation. It aims to
						demystify AI and lower the barrier of entry for aspiring artists,
						designers and thinkers. It also consolidates the current discourse
						and knowledge around AI in art and design, making visible the tacit
						knowledge that can help answer more embedded questions such as that
						of artificial creativity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout this text, artificial intelligence (AI) is used
						interchangeably with machine learning (ML).

						Writing an essay (preferred):<br />
						I would like to invite you to participate with an essay reflecting on
						your practice and your thoughts and views on AI. The following questions
						may serve as a guide or inspiration for your writing:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Why is AI interesting for your artistic practice/work? What did
							you hope to achieve when you decided to work with AI?
						</li>
						<li>
							How do you work with AI algorithms? What are the roles of you and
							AI in your collaboration?
						</li>
						<li>
							What workflow/methodology/tools do you use to create this
							collaboration? Where do these methods appear in your work?
						</li>
						<li>
							What do you think your (artistic) practice reveals about the
							"creativity" embedded in the algorithms used in AI?
						</li>
						<li>How does AI fit into the broader context of (art) history?</li>
						<li>
							How does your work reflect (critically) on the current state of
							AI?
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						I would like to point out that these questions should serve as
						helpful inspiration, but it is not necessary to answer them. In the
						end, you are free to write what you think is best for the
						publication. In addition, I would encourage you to use images in
						your essays to help present your ideas better. Especially,
						references to your previous (artistic) work are always welcome.
					</p>

					<p class="mt-1">
						Participating in an interview:<br />
						If participating with an essay is not suitable for you I can offer you
						an interview, that focuses on similar questions as an alternative. If
						you prefer this option, please write me an <a
							href="mailto:hello@francesco-scheffczyk.de">e-mail</a
						> to schedule an appointment.

				</div>
				<div class="content__section-text">
					<p>
						The publication will exist in a hybrid form. This means that it will
						exist as a website and as a printed book. Using web-to-print
						technology, the printed version will be generated based on the web
						version. Because web technology was not designed to create print
						layouts and documents, this creates friction and perhaps even
						errors. The friction created by the digital and physical existence
						of the publication metaphorically represents the friction and
						differences between human creativity and artificial creativity,
						between human intelligence and artificial intelligence.
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition, AI will also play a critical role in the editorial
						decisions that are made in the publication. Commenting on the
						current overuse of chat interfaces as the main way to interact with
						generative AI, the publication will also exist as a chat interface.
						This allows the model to curate the content of the publication based
						on search queries provided by the reader. Using a technology called
						<a
							href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Paper.pdf"
							>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a
						>, the model can index and understand the publication and navigate
						the reader to articles that are relevant to their query.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because you, the participant, form the knowledge base that the AI
						models refer to, you control the behaviour and responses of the
						model. Keep this in mind as you write, and feel free to think of
						your writing as an experimental approach to creating moments of
						surprise for both the AI model and the readers. ðŸ˜‰

						This project is part of my current master studies in the <a
							href="https://digitalmedia-bremen.de/">Digital Media programm</a
						> at <a href="https://www.hfk-bremen.de/en">HfK Bremen</a> and is unfortunately
						financially limited. Therefore no financial compensation can be guaranteed.
					</p>

					<p>
						Nevertheless, I am currently in ongoing project funding applications
						and discussions with publishers. If enough funding is acquired or an
						agreement is reached with a publisher, subsequent financial
						compensation will be payed.
